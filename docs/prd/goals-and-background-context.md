# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a unique, memorable portfolio website that showcases technical skills through an innovative music-themed experience
- Demonstrate full-stack capabilities (React, Python, AI/ML, FastAPI, LangChain) through the portfolio itself
- Tell Diego's professional story in a cohesive, engaging way that stands out from traditional portfolios
- Provide recruiters with easy access to project evidence, skills, and contact information
- Create an immersive experience that blends technology and music, reflecting Diego's genuine interests

## Background Context

Diego is a technically skilled developer with expertise spanning frontend (React, TypeScript), backend (Python, FastAPI), AI/ML (LangChain, vector databases), and cloud technologies (GCP, AWS, Firebase). He has a passion for music and wants to create a portfolio that reflects both his technical capabilities and creative interests.

Traditional portfolios are often static, boring, and forgettable. Diego wants to create something that recruiters will remember - a portfolio that IS the demonstration of his skills, not just a description of them. By combining his technical expertise with his love for music, he can create a truly unique "Playlist Portfolio" where each section is a "track" in his professional journey, complete with his own music, interactive visualizations, and an AI-powered chatbot "DJ" that can answer questions about his background.

This portfolio will serve as both a creative showcase and a practical hiring tool, providing an immersive experience while ensuring recruiters can quickly find the information they need.
