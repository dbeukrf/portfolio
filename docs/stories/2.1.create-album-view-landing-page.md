- Frontend React + Vite project is fully set up in `apps/web/` directory
- Complete design system with theme, colors, typography, and spacing is implemented
- All frontend dependencies are installed and configured
- Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces is established
- Frontend runs on localhost:5173 (Vite default)
- Backend FastAPI project is set up and running
- Routing system is configured with React Router v6

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Frontend Framework:** React 18.2.x with TypeScript 5.3.x
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 3.4.x for utility-first CSS
- **Routing:** React Router 6.21.x for client-side routing
- **Icons:** Lucide React 0.303.x for consistent icon system
- **Testing:** Vitest 1.1.x + React Testing Library 14.1.x

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md#component-app]
- **App Component:** Root component with routing setup and global providers
- **Page Components:** Located in `apps/web/src/pages/` directory
- **Component Structure:** Use PascalCase naming convention
- **Default Export:** All components must export default the main component

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#track-model]
- **Track Interface:** Use shared Track type from `@shared/types/Track`
- **TrackId Type:** 'university' | 'work' | 'projects' | 'skills' | 'hobbies'
- **TRACKS Constant:** Import from shared package with all 5 tracks
- **Track Properties:** id, number, title, description, audioUrl, duration, mood

### File Locations
Based on the source tree structure:
- **Page Component:** `apps/web/src/pages/AlbumView.tsx` (create new file)
- **Routing:** Update `apps/web/src/App.tsx` to include AlbumView route
- **Track Data:** Import from `packages/shared/src/types/Track.ts`
- **Styles:** Use TailwindCSS classes, no additional CSS files needed
- **Tests:** Create `apps/web/src/pages/AlbumView.test.tsx` (colocated)

### Critical Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **Rule 5:** All imports from shared package must use @shared alias
- **Rule 6:** Component files must export default the main component
- **Rule 1:** No localStorage or sessionStorage (use Zustand for state)
- **Rule 3:** Audio visualizations must use requestAnimationFrame (not applicable for this story)

### Responsive Design Requirements
- **Mobile First:** Design for mobile, then scale up
- **Breakpoints:** Use TailwindCSS responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- **Spotify-like Design:** Album artwork at top, track list below
- **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44px for mobile interaction
- **Typography:** Use design system typography hierarchy

### Navigation Integration
- **React Router:** Use useNavigate hook for programmatic navigation
- **Route Structure:** / (AlbumView), /track/:trackId (TrackView)
- **Start Button:** Navigate to first track or begin album experience
- **Deep Linking:** Ensure URLs work when shared

### Testing Requirements
